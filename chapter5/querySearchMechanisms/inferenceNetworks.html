        <h3>2.3  Inference Networks</h3>


	<p><em>Indexes can also be considered as &#8220;precompiled links&#8221;, providing immediate
access to required information without navigating through the &#8220;document
space&#8221;</em> <a href="../../references.html#frissecousins89" title="Bibliography of Frisse &#38; Cousins, 1989">[Frisse &#38; Cousins, 1989]</a>.  While nodes (containing information)
can be considered part of the document space, <a href="contentQueries.html" title="Jump to Content Queries and Indexes">indexes or index nodes</a> can be treated as part of
the &#8220;index space&#8221;. In traditional full-text document retrieval systems, the
document space and index space are essentially flat (they are together).
<em>Frisse and Cousins suggest the use of a hierarchical index space and a
networked document space for information retrieval in hypertext systems</em>.
They have investigated the representation of index spaces as belief
networks. Croft and Turtle have also proposed an IR model for hypertext
systems based on plausible or non-deductive inference using Bayesian
inference networks <a href="../../references.html#croftturtle89" title="Bibliography of Croft &#38; Turtle, 1989">[Croft &#38; Turtle, 1989]</a>. Belief networks or Bayesian
inference networks are directed, acyclic dependency graphs where nodes
represent propositional variables and links or edges represent
probabilistic relationships between the propositions. A hypertext system
can be compared to such a network &#8211; the roots of the dependency graph are
hypertext <a href="../../chapter1/intro/nodesLinks.html" title="Jump to Nodes and Links">nodes</a>; interior nodes and
leaves represent concepts.</p>


	<p>User&#8217;s likes and dislikes are transmitted recursively from all nodes
representing concepts (in the document space) to nodes in the index space.
Based on this degree of belief, appropriate values are assigned to index space
nodes.  These changes are propagated throughout the index space using standard
Bayesian techniques.  If a proposition represented by a node <strong>p</strong> directly
implies the proposition represented by node <strong>q</strong>, a directed graph is drawn
from <strong>p to q</strong>.  If-then rules in the Bayesian network are interpreted as
conditional probabilities, that is, a rule <strong>A&#8212;&gt; B</strong> is interpreted as
a probability <strong>P(B|A)</strong>.  Given a set of prior probabilities for the roots
of the <span class="caps">DAG</span> the probability associated with the remaining nodes can be computed.
Belief values of nodes of interest to a reader increase in value while nodes
not of interest generally decrease in value.  These probabilistic inference
techniques applied to a hierarchical index space greatly enhances the
information retrieval process in hypertext or networked document spaces.</p>


	<p>Optimal retrieval effectiveness can be obtained by ranking nodes according to
estimates of the probability that the query is true given a particular
hypertext node.  The ranking function is approximately equivalent to giving
each node a score that is the sum of the weights of matching query terms, where
the weights depend  on the frequency of occurrence of a term in each hypertext
node and in the entire collection of hypertext nodes.  This simple retrieval
model can be further extended by introducing dependencies that represent links
between hypertext nodes.  This means if hypertext node <strong>j</strong> is indexed by a
particular concept and is linked to a hypertext node <strong>k</strong>, then there is
some probability that hypertext node <strong>k</strong> should also be indexed by that
concept.</p>


	<p><em>However, the application of Bayesian techniques to a complex graph is
NP-complete</em>.  <em>It is also not clear whether adaptive IR systems based on
Bayesian inference techniques converge on the appropriate set of index space
nodes given imprecise information</em>.  <em>Frisse and Cousins are of the
opinion that the computational complexity of this approach needs more
investigation</em>.  Some of the other restrictions include that the network
topology cannot include directed cycles and that queries with evaluable
predicates such as greater than, less than etc., cannot be handled.</p>


	<p><em>Lucarella suggests a similar model for hypertext-based IR</em>.  <em>While
content nodes form the document network, there can be concept nodes forming the
concept network</em> (see <a href="inferenceNetworks.html#figure5_1">Figure 5.1</a>) <a href="../../references.html#lucarella90" title="Bibliography of Lucarella, 1990">[Lucarella, 1990]</a>.  These
concept nodes can serve as an index to the document network.  The concept
network is similar to the index space proposed by Frisse and Cousins. 
Links within the concept network establish associations between concepts. 
The type of the link can describe the nature of semantic association while
a weight assigned to it can reflect the strength of the association.  The
resulting hypertext knowledge base (containing the concept network embedded
within the document network) can be used for query analysis.</p>


	<p>Based on a natural language query, the system will perform a search on the
concept network to find the most pertinent sets of concepts.  Concept
recognition takes place by matching the various terms in the query and
evaluating the matched expressions by applying similarity functions.  Based on
the degree of similarity between the concept and the matched item, a weight is
associated to each concept.  The search can be stopped based on the number of
concept nodes examined and the number of top ranking concepts identified.</p>

Figure 5.1. A Model for Hypertext-Based Information Retrieval <a href="../../references.html#lucarella90" title="Bibliography of Lucarella, 1990">[Lucarella, 1990]</a>.</p>


	<p>Information is retrieved from the document network based on these retrieved
concepts.  Along with the exact set of documents, other sets of documents found
to be semantically related to the topic of interest will be retrieved based on
the weights assigned to the concepts.  For example, a query to retrieve
documents concerned with &#8220;expert systems&#8221; may also retrieve documents
discussing &#8220;knowledge-based systems&#8221; since the two concepts are semantically
related.</p>
