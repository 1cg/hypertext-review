        <h2>5 Collaborative Work and Computer Mediated Communications</h2>


	<p>Hypermedia is highly appropriate for collaborative work.  In addition to
being used as a tool for <a href="ideaProcessing.html" title="Jump to Idea Processing">idea processing</a>, <a href="../chapter1/systemsPeople/notecards.html" title="Jump to NoteCards">NoteCards</a> has been used for
collaborative writing.  <em>Since this activity can be highly coupled and
unstructured, hypermedia is the most appropriate technology to represent both
the work and the discussion about the work (meta-discussion) and about sharing
the medium</em> <a href="../references.html#irishtrigg90" title="Bibliography of Irish &#38; Trigg, 1990">[Irish &#38; Trigg, 1990]</a>.  <em>Also, the rationale for decisions
made during the writing activity can be preserved for historical purposes</em>.
NoteCards provided the environment for people to capture, structure,
compare, and manage large amounts of loosely structured textual, graphical, and
numerical information.  In order to support the social interactions
inherent in collaborative work and shared access to networks of information,
NoteCards required multi-user access and concurrency control mechanisms, and
version control.  <em>Irish and Trigg state that hypermedia is a good</em>
<em>medium for supporting meta-discussions for the following reasons</em>:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Meta-discussion often needs to directly refer to portions of the actual
  discussion.</li>
		<li>A record of the meta-discussion preserved in context can be valuable for
  historical and chronological access.</li>
	</ul>


	<p><em>From a Computer Mediated Communications (CMC) point of view, <a href="../chapter1/intro/hypertext.html" title="Jump to Hypertext">hypertext</a> can be &#8220;viewed as a mechanism to enable an
individual to impose a cognitive viewpoint on a collaborative database, and
to facilitate group agreement on a shared understanding of the resulting
semantics.&#8221;</em> <a href="../references.html#turoff91" title="Bibliography of Turoff et al., 1991">[Turoff et al., 1991]</a>. In a group project, each member of the team
is working towards a sub-goal which forms part of a larger objective for
the organization. Such an environment requires tracking, linking, and
reorganization of information related to various sub-goals and the main
goal itself. <em>It can be argued that every <span class="caps">CMC</span> system capable of mail,
conferences, comments, replies, and notifications can be viewed as a
variation of the hypertext concept</em>. For example, in <span class="caps">EIES2</span>, the facilities
to reply to a mail item or add an attachment which form branches to the
original piece of material can be considered a hypertext feature. The
ability to cross-reference through keywords, and associated comments can be
considered another hypertext feature.</p>


	<p>Turoff et al., extend the <a href="../chapter6/modelsFrameworks/generalFramework.html" title="Jump to General Hypertext Framework">general framework</a> for hypertext functionality, to include a general
morphology of terms for <a href="../chapter1/intro/nodesLinks.html" title="Jump to Nodes and Links">node and link</a>
types. Such a general approach allows users of a system to freely assign
their own semantics to objects and relationships. <em>The semantic model for
hypertext-based collaborative systems should support the full range of
human intellectual <a href="../chapter4/usabilityAndEval/skills.html" title="Jump to Skills of the readers as information users">abilities</a></em>. That is,
such a system should allow any group member to define and describe objects
(nodes) and relationships (links) between objects incorporating the full
range of possible meanings for those nodes and links. Collaborative
hypertext should also provide information about the composition or
evolution process, the way the network is dynamically changing. This can be
achieved by creating a &#8220;group memory&#8221; where nodes and links created during
the collaborative process can be accumulated. Collaborative hypertext
systems should support &#8220;collaborative intelligence where the group can
obtain a far more intelligent result than the most intelligent member would
have acting alone.&#8221; <a href="../references.html#turoff91" title="Bibliography of Turoff et al., 1991">[Turoff et al., 1991]</a>.</p>


	<p>An application called InterNote has been implemented in the Intermedia
framework to support annotative collaboration <a href="../references.html#catlin89" title="Bibliography of Catlin et al., 1989">[Catlin et al., 1989]</a>.
The annotative collaboration process involves commenting, questioning and
critiquing others&#8217; work.  In addition, these notes or annotations can be
assimilated back into the original document to create a new and improved
version of the document. The facility to incorporate annotations into the
original document, resulting in data transfer across the annotation link,
is called <em>warm linking</em>. The system also supports annotation management,
simultaneous multi-user annotation, and contention management.</p>


	<p>The Virtual Notebook System (VNS) is a collaborative environment for scientific
groups engaged in basic and clinical research in an academic medical center
<a href="../references.html#shipmaniii89" title="Bibliography of Shipman III et al., 1989">[Shipman III et al., 1989]</a>.  This system supports information acquisition,
information linking and sharing, and information management in a group
environment.  It is capable of maintaining information about hypotheses,
notes, and other relevant information which can be shared with other
researchers located at remote sites  The system has facilities to import
information from external sources such as electronic mail, <span class="caps">USENET</span> bulletin
boards, bibliographic services, genetic sequencing information, and clinical
databases.</p>


	<p>Researchers who developed <span class="caps">ABC</span>, a hypermedia system for Artifact-Based
Collaboration, consider the output of a group problem-solving process as an
artifact <a href="../references.html#smithsmith91" title="Bibliography of Smith &#38; Smith, 1991">[Smith &#38; Smith, 1991]</a>.  For example, in the software
development process, the artifact consists of concept papers, architecture,
requirements, design specifications, programs, diagrams, references, and user
manuals.  The system can manage source code trees (as hypertext graphs),
decomposition diagrams, call-flow diagrams, and uses-hierarchy diagrams_.
<span class="caps">ABC</span> contains six key components &#8211; a graph server, a set of graph browsers, a
set of application programs, a shared window conferencing facility for
synchronous and asynchronous communications, real-time audio and video, and a
set of protocol tools to study group behavior and strategies.</p>
