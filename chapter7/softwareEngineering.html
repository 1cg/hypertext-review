        <h2>7 Software Engineering</h2>


	<p><em>Software design and development is accomplished through the cooperative efforts
of team members who have to maintain an active information base in order to
improve communication and coordination</em>.  <em>Such an active information base
can be achieved by applying hypertext to the Software Development Life Cycle
(SDLC)</em> <a href="../references.html#balzer89" title="Bibliography of Balzer et al., 1989">[Balzer et al., 1989]</a>.  A number of documents are produced during
different phases of the life cycle.  These can be integrated together to form a
highly cross-referenced body of information.  For example, a design module in
the design statement can be tied to its appropriate requirements specification
and also to the relevant fragment of source code.  Fragments of code can be
linked to technical manuals.  Similarly, several tools and concepts of software
engineering can be applied to the development, use, and  maintenance of
hypertext systems.</p>


	<p><em>DynamicDesign was developed at Tektronix as a <span class="caps">CASE</span> tool based on hypertext</em>
<a href="../references.html#bigelowriley87" title="Bibliography of Bigelow &#38; Riley, 1987">[Bigelow &#38; Riley, 1987]</a>.  <em>It is used to store and link C source code,
requirements specifications, and other documents</em>.  A utility called
graphBuild converts C source code into a hypertext graph based on the program&#8217;s
call tree.  A data dictionary is built for the program containing its local and
global variables.  It also contains sourceBrowse, a browser that allows the
developer to traverse, view, and edit a source code tree.</p>


	<p><em>The Documents Integration Facility (DIF) was developed at the System Factory,
University of Southern California integrating a hypertext system with software
engineering tools</em> <a href="../references.html#gargscacchi87" title="Bibliography of Garg &#38; Scacchi, 1987">[Garg &#38; Scacchi, 1987]</a>.  <em>This &#8220;software hypertext
system&#8221; was implemented to exploit the facilities of software engineering tools
for automated software development and the unique storage and retrieval
mechanisms of hypertext</em>.  Based on the experiences with <span class="caps">DIF</span>, it was
realized that there was a need for developing a hypertext system that could
utilize its knowledge about its users and their software tasks and products.
Such a system would actively participate in the software development process
rather than being just a passive storage facility.  The researchers later
developed the Intelligent Software Hypertext System (I-SHYS).  The knowledge
about the environment was partly embedded in the design of I-SHYS while the
remaining was defined during the use of I-SHYS.</p>
