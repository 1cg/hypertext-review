        <h2>4 Idea Processing</h2>


	<p>Hypertext systems can be used for idea processing and brainstorming since both
are made of a large number of disparate chunks of information put together by
associations.   Conferencing systems support idea processing and are
suitable for <a href="../chapter1/basicFeatures.html" title="Jump to Basic Features of a Hypertext System">hypertext features</a>.
Hypertext systems can also be used in journalism since it involves putting
together various news items and stories. In fact, research or literature
review such as this paper, will greatly benefit through hypertext authoring
tools instead of word processors. We should be able to scan in the original
documents (copyright laws permitting) used as references. When a reference
is made to a document, a reference item should be created and the user
should have the option to look at the original document on the screen.</p>


	<p><a href="../chapter1/systemsPeople/notecards.html" title="Jump to NoteCards">NoteCards</a> supports such <a href="collabWork.html" title="Jump to Collaborative Work and Computer Communications">collaborative</a> idea processing where users in a group
can create <a href="../chapter1/intro/nodesLinks.html" title="Jump to Nodes and Links">nodes</a>, add links to nodes
created by others, and add annotations to other nodes. <em>It provides a rich
and extensible set of tools to capture, represent, link, manage, and
communicate ideas</em> <a href="../references.html#halasz88a" title="Bibliography of Halasz, 1988a">[Halasz, 1988a]</a>. Users can transform informal and
unstructured ideas into formal analyses and structural representations. In
addition to end-user tools, NoteCards provides a set of well-defined
methods and protocols for programmatically manipulating the hypertext
network. <em>Examples of applications in which NoteCards has been used are
researching and writing complex legal briefs, analyzing arguments presented
in scientific and public policy articles and managing general personal and
project information for small group research projects</em>. It has also been
used for a number of interactive, non-linear, multimedia reference manuals.</p>


	<p><em><span class="caps">SEPIA</span> (Structured Elicitation and Processing of Ideas for Authoring), is an
active, knowledge-based authoring and idea processing tool for creating and
managing hypertext documents</em> <a href="../references.html#streitz89" title="Bibliography of Streitz et al., 1989">[Streitz et al., 1989]</a>.  The main principle
behind this system is the idea of cognitive compatibility &#8211; the system provides
an environment to the author consisting of properties inherent to different
cognitive activities and structures of writing. The system is task-oriented
and through different representations supports the easy mapping of internal
structures to external structures and vice versa. The system provides a
variety of &#8220;activity spaces&#8221; which differ both in structure and
functionality. The &#8220;content space&#8221; provides facilities to collect
information, generate, and structure ideas for the content domain. The
&#8220;planning space&#8221; provides support to the author in setting up an agenda,
coordinating and directing all sub-activities, and monitoring and revising
plans and goals. The &#8220;argumentation space&#8221; serves as the medium for
generating, ordering, and relating arguments for specific issues,
addressing one issue at a time. The &#8220;rhetorical space&#8221; allows structuring
the outline of the final document, the rhetorical organization of positions
and arguments for each sub-issue and the development of a coherent
document.</p>


	<p><em>The writing process is not straightforward but a criss-cross of interactions
between these activity spaces</em>.  Information flows from the planning space
to the other three phases: Issues specified in the planning space set topics
for the content space, direct the structuring of positions and arguments for
the argumentation space which are then transformed into an outline in the
rhetorical space.  On the other hand, information also flows directly from
these spaces back to the planning space.  <em>This helps in refining the
planning space also called &#8220;opportunistic planning&#8221;</em>.</p>
