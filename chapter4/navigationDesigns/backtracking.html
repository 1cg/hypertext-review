        <h3>2.6  Backtracking, History Lists, Timestamps, and Footprints</h3>


	<p>Backtracking allows visiting previously visited nodes.  Backtracking in a
linear fashion and also the ability to <a href="bookmarks.html" title="Jump to Arbitrary Jumps, Landmarks and Bookmarks">arbitrarily jump</a> to previous nodes helps people to bail out of difficult
situations. The most preferred method is the path-following principle which
allows traversing, in reverse order, those nodes that were previously
visited since this approach relies on the user&#8217;s memory of his or her own
navigation behavior. The structure-oriented feedback approach allows users
to directly jump to a node without backtracking. However, experiments have
shown that combining these two methods might lead to confusion <a href="../../references.html#nielsen90a" title="Bibliography of Nielsen, 1990a">[Nielsen, 1990a]</a>.</p>


	<p>Backtracking has been provided in system such as <a href="../../chapter1/systemsPeople/guide.html" title="Jump to Guide">Guide</a> and
HyperCard. However, most backtracking mechanisms do not support the feature
of going forward to the node from which the backtracking was initiated.
Also, backtracking can confuse users if the interface is not consistent. In
a document designed with <a href="../../chapter1/systemsPeople/guide.html" title="Jump to Guide">Guide</a> when readers returned from a
backtracking operation the display looked different making them wonder
whether that was the node they were viewing before taking off on the
backtrack <a href="../../references.html#nielsen90b" title="Bibliography of Nielsen, 1990b">[Nielsen, 1990b]</a>. Hence, Nielsen suggests that backtracking
mechanisms must fulfill two requirements &#8211; &#8220;It should always be available,
and it should always be activated in the same way.&#8221;</p>


	<p><em>A textual history list mechanism was developed for <a href="../../chapter1/systemsPeople/notecards.html" title="Jump to NoteCards">NoteCards</a>
which maintains an ordered list of each notecard that was examined in a
particular session</em>. Users can select an item from the list and look
through a <a href="graphicalBrowsers.html" title="Jump to Graphical Browsers">browser</a>. Nodes that
have already been visited in a session are marked with a plus sign, one for
each time visited. <em>Visual indicators such as the plus sign or checkmarks
or asterisks serve as &#8220;footprints&#8221; on overview diagrams and help users to
avoid returning to nodes that have been recently visited</em>. Some
implementations of the history list allow users to customize the list for
future interaction. A variation of the history list called the history tree
shows the users &#8220;how&#8221; they traversed a set of linked nodes, the
digressions, and multiple visits to nodes. Both the history list and
history tree can be saved and annotated with text and graphics <a href="../../references.html#uttingyankelovich89" title="Bibliography of Utting &#38; Yankelovich, 1989">[Utting &#38; Yankelovich, 1989]</a>.</p>


	<p>HyperCard has a graphical history list called the recent list which has
miniature snap-shots of the last forty-two nodes visited.  Clicking on a
miniature brings that card to the display.  Of course, this method makes the
assumption that an individually may not be able to remember the name of the
node but may remember the <a href="../../chapter2/generalGuidelines/presentationPart.html" title="Jump to The Presentation Part">&#8220;look&#8221; of the node</a>.  Some <a href="../usabilityAndEval/index.html" title="Jump to Index">usability studies</a> have shown that it is very difficult for users
to distinguish these miniatures from one another <a href="../../references.html#nielsen90a" title="Bibliography of Nielsen, 1990a">[Nielsen, 1990a]</a>.</p>


	<p><em>Nodes that are visited can be timestamped (along with the accumulated time
spent at each node) and maintained in a chronological order</em> <a href="../../references.html#nielsen90a" title="Bibliography of Nielsen, 1990a">[Nielsen, 1990a]</a>.  
This feature will help users, at a later date, to recognize whether the
node was visited before and if so, the duration allowing users to change
their viewing behavior accordingly. The Document Examiner supports a
history of commands executed and a history of documents examined. The
command history allows people to see previously executed commands and the
document history is in the form of <a href="bookmarks.html" title="Jump to Arbitrary Jumps, Landmarks and Bookmarks">bookmarks</a> for each document that was previously opened.</p>
