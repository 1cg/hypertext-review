        <h3>2.4  Paths and Trails</h3>


	<p>In most current hypertext systems, readers have a problem trying to understand
the material presented because they view it in the wrong order or they simply
cannot comprehend easily.  <em>The concept of a path can help solve this problem
by allowing authors to determine an appropriate order of presentation for a
given audience</em>.  <em>It will reduce both <a href="../intro/disorientation.html" title="Jump to Disorientation">disorientation</a> and <a href="../intro/cognitiveOverhead.html" title="Jump to Cognitive Overhead">cognitive overhead</a>
since users will follow a pre-defined path which will also narrow down
their choices</em>.  The concept of paths or trails was first enunciated by Bush
in his classic paper, &#8220;As We May Think&#8221;.  He called a trail a sequence of links
through a <a href="../../chapter1/systemsPeople/memex.html" title="Jump to Memex">memex</a>.</p>


	<p>&#8220;The process of tying two items together is the important thing [...]
Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing
positions [...] he user taps a single key, and the items are permanently
joined [...] Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view,
the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button [...]
oreover, when numerous items have thus been joined together to form a
trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly [...] It is exactly
as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely
separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It is more than
this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails [...] rails do not
fade [...] everal years later, [...] tapping a few keys projects the head
of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at intersecting
items, going off on side excursions.&#8221; <a href="../../references.html#bush45" title="Bibliography of Bush, 1945">[Bush, 1945]</a>.</p>


	<p>The idea of trails was implemented as paths by Trigg in his 
<a href="../../chapter1/systemsPeople/textnet.html" title="Jump to Textnet"><span class="caps">TEXTNET</span> system</a>. In <a href="../../chapter1/systemsPeople/intermedia.html" title="Jump to Intermedia">Intermedia</a>, a
path is a list of documents users visited earlier in a browsing session.
The display of a path consists of the name of the document, an icon
indicating the type of event (opening or activating documents), and a
timestamp indicating when the event occurred. A user&#8217;s path is saved when
closing the web and restored when opening the web, the next time. Thus, a
path can be used to collect all interesting documents to <a href="../../chapter2/linearizationHypertext.html" title="Jump to Linearization of Hypertext">form a linear document</a> that can be
preserved in printed form <a href="../../references.html#uttingyankelovich89" title="Bibliography of Utting &#38; Yankelovich, 1989">[Utting &#38; Yankelovich, 1989]</a>.</p>


	<p>The Scripted Documents System, developed at <span class="caps">XEROX</span>, uses paths which are
procedural and programmable. The items in the path (nodes) can be &#8220;active&#8221; 
entries or scripts which can do <a href="../../chapter3/requirementsNG/computation.html" title="Jump to Computation">computations</a>, execute programs etc. The entries provide the content while
the path provides <a href="../../chapter2/generalGuidelines/organizationalPart.html" title="Jump to The Organizational Part">sequencing</a>.
Paths can be created and edited using path editors. Readers can get local
and global views of relevant paths. Playback mechanisms are supported which
allow users to play back a path either single-stepped or automatic.
Different kinds of scripts provide different paths and can be used to
create presentations for different classes of audiences <a href="../../references.html#zellweger89" title="Bibliography of Zellweger, 1989">[Zellweger, 1989]</a>.</p>
