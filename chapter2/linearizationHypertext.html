        <h2>6  Linearization of Hypertext</h2>


The <a href="conversion/index.html" title="Jump to Index">reverse problem of converting</a> 
text to hypertext is to linearize a hypertext document for printing. <em>The
need for a <a href="conversion/limitationsPrintedText.html" title="Jump to Limitation of Printed Text">linear, printed document</a> will exist for some time to come</em>.
Yankelovich et al. suggest that &#8220;printing a branching [hypertext] document
in a linear fashion poses both technical and conceptual problems.&#8221; <a href="../references.html#yankelovich85" title="Bibliography of Yankelovich et al., 1985">[Yankelovich et al., 1985]</a>. It is easy to linearize a hypertext document having a
strict hierarchical structure by performing a depth-first tree traversal,
by printing the first chapter and its sections and moving onto the next
chapter and so on. However, <em>in the general case where the hypertext
document is a highly connected network without any special order, it is
very difficult to produce a good linear document</em> <a href="../references.html#nielsen90c" title="Bibliography of Nielsen, 1990c">[Nielsen, 1990c]</a>.

	<p>Activities involved in the production of a linear document are together
referred as &#8220;document preparation&#8221; <a href="../references.html#triggirish87" title="Bibliography of Trigg &#38; Irish, 1987">[Trigg &#38; Irish, 1987]</a>.  According to
Trigg and Irish, document preparation does not include writing activities such
as notetaking and reorganizing.  It can happen throughout the writing process,
often commencing well before the final text is composed.  Paper structuring or
layout is done in an outline, which is massaged and fine-tuned for some time
before any text is written.  In <a href="../chapter1/systemsPeople/notecards.html" title="Jump to NoteCards">NoteCards</a>, the outline takes the form of a
filebox hierarchy whose filebox titles correspond to section titles of the
paper.   Some writers just use a single text card to capture the overall
structure of the paper to be written.  This may involve pulling up other
relevant cards and copying text from these note or paraphrasing.  This kind of
a composition of text (essentially in a linear fashion) is the same as moving
away from the concept of hypertext.  Smoothing the document and integration is
done with the linear document rather than with the source cards.</p>


	<p>The connection between the linear form and the hypertext document can be
maintained over time.  This can be done using document cards which allow users
to automatically generate a linear document, in a card, covering some portion
of the network.  Changes to the document are made in the source cards from
which the document was compiled.  This allows portions of the paper to be
visible in different windows and simultaneously accessible <a href="../references.html#triggirish87" title="Bibliography of Trigg &#38; Irish, 1987">[Trigg &#38; Irish, 1987]</a>.</p>


	<p>The SmarText Electronic Document Construction Set, a software product that
automates the creation and browsing of large hypertext document, presents
multiple views of non-linear text in a linear fashion.  SmarText readers can
choose to traverse one path out of many possible paths.  A <a href="../chapter4/navigationDesigns/paths.html" title="Jump to Paths and Trails">path</a> is essentially a linear presentation of specific nodes
connected by specific links. The text, the index and outlines are
constrained by the selected view or path <a href="../references.html#rearick91" title="Bibliography of Rearick, 1991">[Rearick, 1991]</a> . The concept of
paths has also been explored using the Scripted Document System at Xerox
<a href="../references.html#zellweger89" title="Bibliography of Zellweger, 1989">[Zellweger, 1989]</a>. A path can also be used to collect all interesting
documents to form a linear document that can be printed <a href="../references.html#uttingyankelovich89" title="Bibliography of Utting &#38; Yankelovich, 1989">[Utting &#38; Yankelovich, 1989]</a>. Another possible method of linearizing hypertext is
to take the user&#8217;s history of interaction and print the contents of the
nodes that were traversed during a particular session.</p>
