        <h2>2  Object-Oriented Concepts and Hypermedia</h2>


	<p>Before we discuss the database <a href="requirementsNG/index.html" title="Jump to Index">requirements</a> of hypermedia, let us try to
understand the object-oriented paradigm and analyze its relevance to
hypermedia.  <em>The advantages of using an <span class="caps">OODBMS</span> includes the ability to model
complexity, to provide a unified representation of the problem domain, and to
build complex objects</em>.</p>


	<p>There have been object-oriented approaches to systems analysis and design,
programming languages, operating systems and database systems.  Object-oriented
systems provide many new features that are not present in conventional
structured systems.  The object-oriented paradigm more closely represents the
problem domain by mapping abstractions of real world entities as
objects/classes.  It also focuses on the definition and inheritance of
behavioral capabilities in the form of operations embedded within objects.  The
paradigm also supports simpler capabilities for structuring complex objects.</p>


	<p>Object-oriented systems, including languages and database management systems
support concepts such as objects, classes, methods, data abstraction,
encapsulation, inheritance, schema evolution, reusability,concurrency control,
correctness, polymorphism, composite objects, active objects, version control
and direct manipulation <a href="../references.html#cattell91" title="Bibliography of Cattell, 1991">[Cattell, 1991]</a>.</p>


	<p><em>Many features from the world of object-oriented analysis, design and
programming can be extended to the hypertext model</em>.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Simple <a href="../chapter1/intro/nodesLinks.html" title="Jump to Nodes and Links">nodes</a> can be compared to atomic
  objects representing primitive data types such as integer, character,
  string, video frame and bitmap.</li>
		<li>Objects or nodes can be accessed using object identifiers or node identifiers.</li>
		<li>A link can be represented by a set of at least two object identifiers. 
  Links can also be treated as objects with their own identifiers (link
  identifiers) which can be used to separate index information from
  content.</li>
		<li>A composite node in hypertext (made of webs of nodes and links) can be
  treated as a composite object or an aggregation of simple objects. </li>
		<li>The concepts of data abstraction and encapsulation can be applied by
  defining methods to create, delete, update and manipulate nodes and
  links, to traverse links, and to trigger events. </li>
		<li>Nodes and links can be grouped under different classes based on
  structural and behavioral patterns (semantics).  Organizing nodes and
  links semantically helps manage the network better, eliminates ambiguity,
  clearly differentiating the purposes of these objects.</li>
		<li>Nodes and links of a particular class can also inherit properties from
  related superclasses.  This feature can be used in the creation and
  management of hypermedia templates &#8211; when a user changes a parent
  template, these changes can be propagated to all its sub-classed
  templates.</li>
		<li>Whenever the properties of nodes and links have to be changed it should
  be easy to do so through schema evolution. </li>
		<li>Other object-oriented concepts that are pertinent to hypertext include
  concurrency control, versioning, and persistence.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>In HyperBase, the basic class was a <code>HB_Object</code> which had three subclasses:
<code>HB_Node</code>, <code>HB_Link</code>, and <code>HB_Composite_Object</code> <a href="../references.html#schuttstreitz90" title="Bibliography of Schutt &#38; Streitz, 1990">[Schutt &#38; Streitz, 1990]</a>.
<code>HB_Nodes</code> are <code>HB_Objects</code> with content and history. <code>HB_Links</code> are
<code>HB_Objects</code> that connect two existing <code>HB_Objects</code>. <code>HB_Composite_Objects</code>
are collections of references to existing <code>HB_Objects</code>. The generic
operations of create, modify, copy, delete, retrieve an object (part of or
whole) were supported for nodes, links, composite objects, and attributes.
Since the data model was object-oriented, a natural choice to implement
HyperBase would have been an <span class="caps">OODBMS</span>. However, for reasons of availability,
a first prototype was implemented on Sybase, a <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>.</p>
