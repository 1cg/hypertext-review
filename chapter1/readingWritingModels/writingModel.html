        <h3>4.2  Writing Model</h3>


	<p>Writing is constrained by goal and audience.  The author is guided by a goal
but constrained by what the audience is prepared to accept.  Different people
approach writing in different ways. Some are good at making an outline first
and then brainstroming.  Some do the opposite.  An expert author would always
keep the reading model in mind so that the writing clearly reaches the target
audience.</p>


	<p><em>Writing involves the following three phases : exploring, organizing, and
encoding</em> <a href="../../references.html#rada91" title="Bibliography of Rada, 1991">[Rada, 1991]</a>.  In the Cognitive Framework for Written
Communication (see <a href="writingModel.html#figure1_2">Figure 1.2</a>), Smith et al.  call these three
phases:  prewriting, organizing, and writing <a href="../../references.html#smith87" title="Bibliography of Smith et al., 1987">[Smith et al., 1987]</a>.</p>


	<p class="center"><img src="../../images/chapter12.gif" id="figure1_2" title="Cognitive Framework for Communication" alt="Cognitive Framework for Communication" /><br/>
Figure 1.2: Cognitive Framework for Written Communication <a href="../../references.html#smith87" title="Bibliography of Smith et al., 1987">[Smith et al., 1987]</a></p>


	<p>Exploring or pre-writing is the process of brainstorming and taking
unstructured notes.  The writer retrieves potential content from long-term
memory or external sources, considers possible relations among ideas, groups
related ideas and  constructs small hierarchical structures.  Thus, the product
of exploration is  a network or directed graph of ideas.</p>


	<p>Organizing is the process of putting these notes or ideas in order, in the form
of an outline or a hierarchy.  This process involves abstract construction that
involves perceiving subordinate/ superordinate relations, comparing
abstractions, sequencing, proportion, and balance.  Thus, the product of
organization is a hierarchy of related concepts.</p>


	<p>Encoding or writing is the final phase of completing the document.  The primary
task is translating the abstractions of content and the relations of a
hierarchical structure into a sequence of words, sentences, paragraphs,
sections, chapters, and illustrations.  The structure of the encoded text is
linear and represents a path through the hierarchy.</p>


	<p><em>It is interesting to note that reading employs processes in the reverse
order</em>.  <em>That is, a linear sequence of words is transformed into a
hierarchy which is later integrated into a network in long-term memory</em>
<a href="../../references.html#smith87" title="Bibliography of Smith et al., 1987">[Smith et al., 1987]</a>.</p>


	<p>The writing model can be extended by considering unstructured and structured
representation at each phase.  Whereas an unstructured item is isolated, a
structured item shows coherence.  Exploring can be split into unstructured
brainstorming followed by structured note-taking.  Organizing can be classified
as unstructured argumentation where relationships are established between ideas
and structured organization of notes where notes are grouped together to make
coherent sense. Encoding has an unstructured phase of linear planning which
involves viewing groups of notes as sequences and a structured phase of
drafting and revising in order to produce a final document (which is a linear
sequence of notes).</p>


	<p>Just as the reader of a linear document constructs a local and global mental
representation of the document, the author of a linear document uses cues both
at the local and at the global levels, dividing the document into chapters,
sections, paragraphs, sentences, words etc.  This facilitates comprehension and
navigation <a href="../../references.html#thuring91" title="Bibliography of Thuring et al., 1991">[Thuring et al., 1991]</a>.</p>


	<p><em>Thus, both reading and writing processes emphasize a lot on the non-linear
nature of thinking, a natural process in human beings</em>.  <em>Human cognition
is essentially organized as a semantic network in which concepts are linked
together by associations</em>.  <em>Hypertext systems try to exploit this basic
nature of cognition</em>.</p>
