        <h3>3.2  Limitations of <span class="caps">ODA</span> and possible modifications</h3>


	<p><acronym title="Open Document Architecture">ODA</acronym>, a standard for the storage and interchange
of <a href="../../chapter3/requirementsNG/multimediaSupport.html" title="Jump to Multimedia Support">multimedia documents</a>, deals
with both logical structure and layout structure or presentation (unlike
<a href="sgmlLimitations.html" title="Jump to Limitations of SGML"><span class="caps">SGML</span></a>). <span class="caps">ODA</span> currently includes
graphics and images and extensions are being considered to handle audio,
video, and hypertext <a href="../../references.html#colebrown90" title="Bibliography of Cole &#38; Brown, 1990">[Cole &#38; Brown, 1990]</a>.</p>


	<h4>a.  Separation of logical structure and layout structure</h4>


	<p>Though <span class="caps">ODA</span> supports both logical structure and layout structure, they are not
completely separated.  In order to change the style of a document the logical
structure must be edited since the layout process uses the logical structure,
the generic structures and the content architectures to create the specific
layout.  This limitation can be eliminated by carrying over the <span class="caps">SGML</span> mechanism
of applying different set of layout and presentation styles (or style sheets)
for different views of the same logical document.</p>


	<h4>b.  Comprehensive attribute inheritance</h4>


	<p>The <span class="caps">ODA</span> mechanism for inheriting layout attributes (such as placement of blocks
of contents within pages and rectangular areas called frames) and presentation
attributes (such as character sets and the placement of items within blocks) is
not sufficient.  If an attribute value is not specified for the object or its
class, then the value can only be inherited according to the object&#8217;s position
in the tree and not according to its class (chapter, list etc.).</p>


	<p>Attribute inheritance can be achieved by adding a facility called &#8220;style
tables&#8221; which will enable the style inherited by an object (and hence its
format) to depend both on its class and is position in the document.  This will
be very valuable for hypertext in order to distinguish between objects of the
same type that have different status (such as open and close buttons).  It can
also be extended to specify changes of state (for example, when selecting a
hotspot) by changing the style table.</p>


	<h4>c.  Links</h4>


	<p><span class="caps">ODA</span> does not have the ability to specify the purpose of a link and also how the
layout process can express that purpose.  This can be accomplished by having
classes for links (just as there are classes for logical objects).  The class
of the link will determine how and where in the document the link can be used.
Thus, the representation of the link will depend on both the class and its
position in the document.</p>


	<h4>d.  Selective and multiple presentation</h4>


	<p><span class="caps">ODA</span> does not have the ability to suppress the appearance of a logical object
(or contents) during the layout process nor the ability to present the object
many times.  Such a feature will be of great help in a hypertext document where
a reviewer&#8217;s comments can be suppressed from appearing in a printout or
different versions of the same basic document can be produced for various
purposes.  This can also be accomplished by the usage of style tables suggested
earlier.</p>


	<h4>e.  Complete interactivity</h4>


	<p>The <span class="caps">ODA</span> layout process is sequential and page based and hence does not provide
complete interactivity.  It does not support online editing capabilities such
as the ability to scroll through a document, the ability to display selected
items (outlining facility), the ability to popup additional information on
demand (such as footnotes, glossaries etc.), the ability to &#8220;fold&#8221; documents
revealing hidden sections only on request, the ability to follow links
automatically.</p>


	<p>Complete interactivity would require extensions.  Outlining can be done by
having style tables that select objects by class and required level.  Popup
displays can be arranged by changing to a different style table and returning
to the original table after the popup information has been displayed.
Similarly, folding can be achieved indirectly through popups and popdowns.
Link traversal can be done by replacing the current object with the target
object or displaying the target object as a temporary popup item.  A style
table can be used to specify whether or not to display the linked object.</p>
